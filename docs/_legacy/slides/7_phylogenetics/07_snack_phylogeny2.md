## Snack phylogeny

In this exercise, we'll explore the impact of age information on topology.

Below are the trees you produced yesterday. Today you have some additional information about the age of each snack.

* Oreos: 1912
* Toffifee: 1973
* Milch mause: company established  1961
* Nutella Biscuits: 2019
* Leibniz: company established 1891
* Kuhbonbon: company established 1976
* Apple domesticated: 4000â€“10000 years ago

Discuss the following in your groups:

 * **Is your tree compatible with this age information?**
 * **Would you make any changes to your tree?**
