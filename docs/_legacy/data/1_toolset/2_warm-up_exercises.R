# 0. Read in the Palmer penguin dataset!

# 1. Use multiple ways to select the subset that corresponds to the Gentoo and the Adelie penguins!

# 2. With a loop for every species, select the species specific-part of the dataset, create a directory for it and write it into the new directory in rds and csv format! 

# 3. Change the previous code to save the subsets in a list. Use the species names as the names of the list!

# 5. Write a function that returns parts of the dataset based on column name and value, either greater or equal/lower or lower or equal to the value. function(x, column, value, greater)
