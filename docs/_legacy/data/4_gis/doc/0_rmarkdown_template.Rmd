```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(knitr)
```

# Heading level 1

This is some random text. Usual markdown stuff. 

## Some code examples

This is some basic calculation, creating random values. 
```{r calc, echo= TRUE}
# comment is also good
a <- rnorm(15)
a
```

This bit of code plots what was created in the previous bit: 

```{r plotting, echo= TRUE, plot=TRUE, fig.height=5.5}
plot(a)
``` 

If everything was correct there should be a figure above this text.
