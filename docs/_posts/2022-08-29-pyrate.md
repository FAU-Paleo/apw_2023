# Estimation of diversity and diversification using Bayesian and deep learning models

In this part of the course we will go over several models in infer preservation, speciation, and extinction processes from fossil occurrence data. Most of the methods do not require a joint estimation of the underlying phylogenetic tree connecting the lineages (which can be both a good and a bad thing).

The classes will include general explanations of how Bayesian inference and MCMC machinery work, and how supervised and unsupervised deep neural networks can be used in the context of macroevolution. 

### Installing Python and dependencies

We will be using mostly software written in Python (3.8 or higher), which can be installed from [python.org ](https://www.python.org/downloads/). In this [tutorial](https://github.com/dsilvestro/PyRate/blob/master/tutorials/pyrate_tutorial_0.md) we show how to set up a virtual environment (`venv`) with all dependencies installed. A `venv` is a local copy of Python that makes sure the libraries installed are compatible with the software we want to run, without interfering with the global Python installed on your machine. 


### PyRate

We will use the software PyRate and follow some of the [available tutorials](https://github.com/dsilvestro/PyRate/tree/master/tutorials#pyrate-tutorials---index) to run Bayesian analyses of fossil occurrence data and estimate variation of speciation and extinction rates through time and among lineages. This will also allow us to test specific hypotheses on the drivers of diversification and extinction. 

The program is written in Python but does not require previous Python knowledge as it is typically run as an executable (just like you don't need to know C++ to run RevBayes).


### rootBBB

We will use the software rootBBB to estimate clade age following its [tutorial](https://github.com/dsilvestro/rootBBB#readme) and with the available [example files](https://github.com/dsilvestro/rootBBB/tree/master/example_data). You are welcome of course to try it with your own data, if applicable.
